  <!-- Code assessment:
       Refactoring points of my Basic Portfolio solution to leverage Bootstrap had some challenges as the Basic Porfolio code 
       is first HTML/CSS effort and while produces visual desired results it is full of room for improvement.
       This Bootstrap version itself could be improved in addition to cleaning up the baggage present from the Basic Portfolio starting point.
       
       Features - Bootstrap:
       
        1. BootStrap Nav bar with expandable/collapsable button rendered at the small breakpoint.  Navbar is sticky top.
        2. About Me page under utlizes Bootstrap using just one row / one 12 width column with sm breakpoint
        3. Portfolio page uses rows / columns for the project collectionw
        4. Contact page also under utilized Bootstrap using two rows with one 12 span column.  Has sm breakpoint 
        5. Small breakpoint activates a static header so that it scrolls up/out of viewport
        6. Some use of media queries to help better fit nav bar icons and footer icon attribution text
        
        
      Missing or pooly inplemented:
      
        1. Margins - need to revisit to get appropriate margins.  Only the larger widths above 960 show appropriate margins.
           Ran out of time exploring where code was falling short and/or needed correction

        2. Portfolio - landscape modes don't always produce a clean center section ending up leaving a column of space in the body
           not fitting in three project columns.

        3. Code passed validation, but really need to refactor it for better techniques, better semantics and eliminating/redoing ids and classes

        4. In the footer the text for Icon attribution text got troublesome on smaller form factors so needed media query to rearange 

        5. Better comments needed throughout

        6. A proper README.md file is needed - looking into templates and ideas via google
        
      Possible enhancements:

        1. Want to move social media links off the nav bar to their one container on the body as they cause challenges at the smaller form factors
